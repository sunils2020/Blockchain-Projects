Description : Project Submission

Notes :
1) I have completed all my testing with minimum about of ethers. (Like 10 to 20 ethers). Incase, you would like to test with more ethers then you need to start the testrpc with enough funds.

2) During the first run of "truffle test" - You may notice "Coinbase balance before" and "Coinbase balance after" is not ideal. This is because I have displayed them as ethers rather than wei. However, next subsequent tests will make it ideal

3) Test case - I have created a timeout so that the project deadline expires. This test case would take 1 minute to complete

4) I have also tested using Mist Wallet. I am attaching the entire screenshot of all the testing including UI testing

5) While creating a project from UI , hover the mouse in deadline field and a Calendar would pop up. ( Calendar.css and calendar.js, momemnt.js is added additionaly for date utility and calendar utility )

Thank you !!! B9Lab material helped me a lot to get into blockchain.
